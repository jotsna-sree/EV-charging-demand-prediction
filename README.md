# Week 1

In this week, we worked on an electric vehicle (EV) dataset that contains information on EV populations, vehicle types, and regional data, including historical charging and registration usage. The dataset records the number of vehicles registered by the **Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)** each month, separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.

## Objective

The goal was to build a **regression model** that forecasts future EV adoption based on historical trends in EV growth, vehicle types, and regional patterns.  
For example, we aimed to **predict the number of electric vehicles** in upcoming years using observed trends in the dataset.

## Workflow

- **Load Dataset**
- **Explore and Understand the Data**
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Basic Data Cleaning
  - Remove Outliers by Capping Values to IQR Bounds
